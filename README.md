# Select.js
## A small library for DOM+SVG manipulation

```
Version :  ${VERSION}
URL     :  http://github.com/sebastien/select.js
```

Select is a small subset of jQuery's functions implemented for DOM and SVG
nodes, and targetting modern browsers. As it uses strict CSS-3 selector
query so won't work as a drop-in replacement to jQuery.

We use it internally at [FFunction](http://ffctn.com) as most of the extra features present
in jQuery (events, promises, requests, animations) are already handled
by our specialized modules, and that jQuery does not work well for SVG 
nodes, which we manipulate a lot.

The functions currently implemented are the following:

Selection
:	
	- `find(selector)`
	- `filter(selector)`

Traversal
:	
	- `first()`
	- `last()`
	- `eq(index)`
	- `next(selector?)`
	- `prev[ious](selector?)`
	- `parent(selector?)`
	- `parents(selector?)`

Manipulation:
:	
	- `attr(attribute, value)`/`attr(attributes)`
	- `css(attribute, value)`/`css(attributes)`
	- `html(value?)`
	- `text(value?)`
	- `val(value?)`
	- `empty()`

Display:
:	
	- `scrollTop(value?)`
	- `scrollLeft(value?)`
	- `width()`
	- `height()`
	- `position()`
	- `offset()`

Events:
:	
	- `bind(event, callback)`/`bind(events)`
	- `ready(callback)`

The library can be used pretty much like you would use jQuery.

```
// Query the elements, and apply the operations
$("ul li:even").text("Hello!");

// It is also available at different locations
$ == S == modules.select
```

Core functions
---------------

Select is based on a couple of basic functions to query, filter and match
nodes against CSS-3 selectors. These work in modern browsers, including
our beloved IE10+.

`select.match(selector:String, node:Node):Boolean`

:	Tells if the given `node` matches the given selector. This
		function uses `Node.{matches|mozMatchesSelector|webkitMatchesSelector}`
		or falls back to a default (obviously slower) implementation.

		The function returns `true` or `false`

`select.query(selector:String, node:Node?):[Node]`

:	Queries all the descendants of node that match the given selector. This
	is a wrapper around `Elemetn.querySelectorAll`.

		The function returns an array of the matching nodes.

`select.query(selector:String, node:Node?):[Node]`

:	Filtes all the nodes that match the given selector. This is a wrapepr
		around `select.filter`. 

		The function returns the subset of the array with matching nodes.

Operations
----------

 The following functions are utility functions used the `Selection` class, 
 but they are also useful generally.

`Selection.Is(value)`

:	Tells if the given value is a `Selection` instance

		select.Selection.Is(new Selection ());

`Selection.IsNode(node)`

:	Tells if the given value is a DOM or SVG node

		select.Selection.IsNodel(document.createElement("div"));

`Selection.IsDom(node)`

:	Tells wether the node is a DOM node or not

		select.Selection.IsDOM(document.createElement("div")) == true;
		select.Selection.IsDOM(document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "svg")) == false;

`Selection.IsDom(node)`

:	Tells wether the node is an SVG node or not

		select.Selection.IsSVG(document.createElement("div")) == false;
		select.Selection.IsSVG(document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "svg")) == true;

Selection & Filtering
---------------------

 These functions allow to query the DOM/SVG tree, find & filter nodes.

`Selection.find(selector)`

:	Finds all the nodes that match the given selector amongst the descendants
		of the currently selected nodes. The resulting selector will have
		this selection as scope only if this selection is not empty.

	- `selector` is expected to be a string
	- the resulting selection will be flat (ie. an array of node)

	```
		select().find("div")
		select("ul").find("li")
	```

`Selection.filter(selector)`

:	Filters all the nodes within the current selection that match
		the give selector. The resulting selection will have
		this selection as scope only if this selection is not empty.

	- `selector` is expected to be a string
	- the resulting selection will be flat (ie. an array of node)

Selection.first()

:	Returns a new selection made of thefirst nodeof this selection. If the
		selection is empty or made of 1 node, this function is transparent.

Selection.last()

:	Returns a new selection made of thelast nodeof this selection. If the
		selection is empty or made of 1 node, this function is transparent.

Selection.eq(index:Integer)

:	Returns a new selection made of thenode at the given `index`.
		if `index` is negative, then the index will be relative to the end
		of the nodes array. If the index is out of the node array bounds,
		the `Empty` selection is returned.

Selection.next(selector:String?)

:	Selects each next sibling element of the current selection. If 
		`selector` is given, only the matching elements will be added.

Selection.previous(selector:String?)

:	Selects each previous sibling element of the current selection. If 
		`selector` is given, only the matching elements will be added.

Main function
-------------

`select(selector, scope)`

:	The main function used to create a selection.
